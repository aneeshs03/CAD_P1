package PipelinedsignedMultiplier1;
A package in Verilog is a way to group related modules, interfaces, and other declarations for convenient organization and reuse.

//  Interface for 32-bit signed multiplier
interface SignedMulInterface;
  method Action start(Int#(32) multiplicand, Int#(32) multiplier);
  method Action done();
  method Int#(64) getResult();
endinterface
This block defines an interface named SignedMulInterface for a 32-bit signed multiplier. The interface has three methods: start, done, and getResult. 
The start method initiates the multiplication, the done method signals the end of computation, and the getResult method retrieves the result.

// Pipelined signed multiplier definition
module mkPipelined32bitSignedMultiplier (SignedMulInterface);
This line starts the definition of a module named mkPipelined32bitSignedMultiplier, which implements the SignedMulInterface interface.

  // Pipeline registers
  Reg#(Int#(32)) multiplicandReg <- mkReg(0);
  Reg#(Int#(32)) multiplierReg <- mkReg(0);
  Reg#(Int#(64)) prodReg <- mkReg(0);
These lines declare three control signals: startStage, multiplyStage, and accumulateStage. These signals control the different stages of the pipeline.

 // Consolidated rule for pipeline stages: Multiply and Accumulate
rule processStages;

This line starts the definition of a rule named processStages, which represents the pipeline stages.

  // Use a nested if-else structure to achieve the desired conditions
  if (startStage) begin

This line checks if the startStage signal is true, indicating the beginning of computation.

verilog

    startStage <= False;

If startStage is true, it is set to false to indicate that the start stage has been processed.

    if (multiplyStage) begin
      // Stage 1: Multiply
      multiplyStage <= False;
      prodReg <= extend(multiplicandReg) * extend(multiplierReg);
    end else if (accumulateStage) begin
      // Stage 2: Accumulate
      accumulateStage <= False;
      prodReg <= prodReg + ((zeroExtend(multiplicandReg) << 32) >> 32);
    end
  end
endrule

Inside the if (startStage) block, there is a nested if-else structure. If multiplyStage is true, it performs the multiplication stage, and if accumulateStage is true,
it performs the accumulation stage. The multiplication is done using the extend function to sign-extend the operands, 
and the accumulation is done by adding the sign-extended multiplicand to the current product.

verilog

  // Interface method to signal the end of computation
  method Action done();
    accumulateStage <= False;
  endmethod

This method is part of the SignedMulInterface and is used to signal the end of computation by setting accumulateStage to false.

verilog

  // Interface method to get the result
  method Int#(64) getResult();
    return prodReg;
  endmethod

This method is part of the SignedMulInterface and returns the result stored in prodReg.

verilog

  // Interface method to start the multiplication
  method Action start(Int#(32) multiplicand, Int#(32) multiplier);
    // Reset pipeline registers
    multiplicandReg <= multiplicand;
    multiplierReg <= multiplier;
    prodReg <= 0;
    startStage <= True;
    multiplyStage <= False;
    accumulateStage <= False;
  endmethod

This method is part of the SignedMulInterface and is used to start the multiplication. It resets the pipeline registers, sets the startStage to true, and initializes 
the multiplicand and multiplier registers with the provided values. The multiplyStage and accumulateStage are set to false, indicating that these stages haven't started yet.

verilog

endmodule
endpackage

These lines close the module and package definitions.

# CAD_P1
Our project is P1 - Pipelined 32 bit & 64 bit signed integer Multiplier

Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV), contains two components:
1. "Module file" contains the hardware description of a module written in Bluespec. It defines the implementation of the hardware component, 

2. "Testbench file"contains the logic for verifying the functionality of a Bluespec module. It includes code to create instances of the module, apply inputs, and observe outputs during simulation.

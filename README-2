This gives an overview of the inputs (references) and outputs, the
(code file namely: "Aneesh_P1_CS6230.ppt", consisting of the output and all the physical constrains considered, and output obtained) and
(the synthesis file named: "output.blif") 
The synthesis file was run, and is uploaded named: "output.blif". You will be able to find the files in the repository.

The code is running and outputs are obtained, sample outputs are attached in the presentation uploaded in the repository.
